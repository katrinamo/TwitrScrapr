From my FB thread on geek / nerd culture in the age of #MeToo:

So many of the things we identify with as nerds, that we loved, love, and were a haven --video games, comics, films -- are problematic. (A lot of my all-time favorite films are pretty sexist.) It sucks.  /1

@Themosthuman @MazMHussain Right, racism ended in 1865.  Or was it 1954? 1964?  2008?  One of those. 

And metoo is silly; if a woman is harassed, all she has to do is come forward and she'll get a fair hearing.  She has no need for other women' support.

If folks could criticize Roseanne Season 2 without asking why she gets a show and a sex criminal doesn't, that'd be great. Because throwing #MeToo under the bus shows you only care for sport, not because critical thought brought you there.

@Kotavor_Rahkkun Except I'm not complaining about that. Like the post I was replying to, I was complaining about there being no difference between accusation and guilt anymore, and while Metoo might have started with good intentions, it's become part of the culture that says Accusation=guilt

@AsiaArgento I’m french, I am not comfortable with #MeToo. Because in more and more cases it turns to a fight against men. I always thought that being a woman is not the best position as we have to work twice as men to be considered equally. BUT I think women can be devils for women. 1/2

Sadly, this was necessary to ensure cops who rape will still face consequences. 

It has been notoriously difficult to prosecute sexual assault in these cases. Police officers will typically close ranks and insist it was consensual.

I had to admit defeat and walk away from 12 years of hard work and a career I had once loved. There was no #metoo movement, I was cheated and disrespected while the man in charge admitted I had been screwed over and the man he replaced me with couldn't handle breaking news.

Without a movement in solidarity, calling out harassing or predatory behaviour was guaranteed to fuck up YOUR life, not the perpetrator’s. The goal was to “manage and move on”. #metoo has changed this, finally.

On this “why didn’t they speak up/not take the work” etc - it’s because harassment and predatory behaviour was/is the world itself, not isolated incidents. From infancy, women have learned to “manage” living in the world. This #metoo thing is new - the world is being made anew.

If #MeToo showed anything, it’s that all women are sexually exploited so just stop it.

@Lead1225 @joandarc33 Finally, due to their victim mentality, intellectual dishonesty and often unrealistic approach to the rape culture, #metoo, women in STEM or upper management, they actually risk provoking a backlash.

@CNN What does #MeToo have to do with his legal proceedings?  The law is the law.  Without new legislation, it doesn't change because of a social phenomenon.  

It's insanely dangerous to think the law should flip with societal trends...

@charles_gaba @dmez15 @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 Maybe pro-gun activists can organize their own march? I’m sure NRA, Nugent &amp; others who support their position would donate to get it organized.
I wouldn’t expect pro-science/Earth Day march to have Pruitt, Pence or Kochs speak or MeToo rally have trump. Messaging has to align.

How Easter became a #MeToo moment. -Whatever you believe about this article. It’s clear that Jesus always sees and hears us. “No one would have invented a woman as a witness.”
Whatever you believe, he sees and loves you like no one else.-

Any apathy exhibited from this user is a facade. MeToo trauma artist "Jurlinia" behaves in a way that mimics social norms as closely as she can. This is not reflective of how she/they truly feels abt the only thing that matters: the disease of violence. https://t.co/EoPa0EwM1Z

“Can I help you with that?” isn’t sexist. “You shouldn’t/can’t do that because you’re a woman,” is sexist. The intent to help is lost once it is established that the help is required because the receiver is a woman. So tired of this from men, feminists or not. #MeToo

@razmisli Всичко това си има аналог. Ако си мъж, има наказание, ако си слабак. Има мъже с различни интереси, но няма значение. Жените НЕ харесват - на дело, а не на думи - отчаяни слабаци. Обществото - също. А за metoo - известните богаташи щяха да са ограбени, ако нямаше какво да ги пази.

The endgame of those behind #metoo &amp; the current #IStandWithHer Movement is CONTROL.
They are no different to the religious orthodoxy that we’ve spent years trying to remove. 
They don’t want to separate church from state - the new religion is the State.

Eventually this mentality will lead to the destruction of someone you actually care about. And what will you say then? Not a damn thing.

Also, celebrating the demise of a single mom, a cancer survivor, in the age of #MeToo is the definition of rich. https://t.co/3d88JdbSLx

These derails, the victim-blamimg? The “struggle love” narrative? The “I need a ride or die, no hoes” bs? Pick mes? Y’alls support of Chris Browns and R. Kellys? #MeToo ? That &amp; more is all abuse culture. You are an integral piece in that structure that allows abuse to continue.

@manboobwpurpose It also feels to me that if there is no mention of the sexual assaults or ANYTHING, it’s a deliberate tactical decision. They know this is happening, and #MeToo is still very much a thing. They should acknowledge it, and then dismiss everyone involved in the subsequent coverup.

@JamesA76451428 I thinks it's the straw that broke the camels back. Personally the entire metoo movement has empowered me to stand up and fight back against an archaic patriarchal system that is no longer relevant to our society. Awareness is the 1st step
