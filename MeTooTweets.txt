But once I made it clear I wasn't interested he made my working life a misery! 

He'd schedule my tea time at 9.30am and lunch at 10:00 then my next tea time at 16:00 - I'd be starving by the time 3 rolled around.

They constantly squaked at BLM, MeToo and every gun debate. Then pivot towards how all women are crazy.

It's so cliché and predictable but they have no interest in changing.

@BadgerPundit @verysmallracoon @perrj1 @RonaldKlain @TonyRobbins @nminow @DavidAFrench @sciam @LauraNoonanFT Sexual assault and harassment IS a problem. Women on college campuses need to be informed and educated on these things because it is likely to happen to them. #metoo encourages women to finally come out about the horrible things that happen to women every day and get justice.

@guinasso @RespectSexWork For instance, why are you not associated with the #MeToo movement?

Banning legal sex work while ignoring a culture that finds degrading women (i.e., grabbing women by ...) is putting a bandaid on a gaping wound.

FB's version of its origin story, its part in the success of #metoo, and how its altruism was ruined by some bad actors is frustrating. FB was an original bad actor as it relates to all things #metoo - a platform designed to rank women based on how hot they are is not altruistic.

Male and female refer to specific reproductive rights. Every human has one right or the other. No one gets to choose or change. No one has both rights, or less than one.

Regretting sex with someone is not sexual harassment. If you didn’t say no that’s on you. women saying #MeToo for such reasons are only harming those with legitimate claims. Society’s past/present attitudes regarding women and those of both genders who perpetuate it are to blame

@ashesvstheworld i'm hesitant to recommend folks bc i don't want to assume that anyone wants to talk about their #metoo experience in that kind of setting. if u know anyone online who is using their platform to talk about it, maybe ask them?

.@TonyRobbins' "motivational speech" is a prime example of exactly what the #MeToo movement is all about: the more qualified woman was not hired because the boss-man was weak.

@TonyRobbins is incredible to speak out about (not against) the #metoo movement. He apologized out of political correctness, but he's brave for speaking out in the first place. He has his own mind &amp; is an amazing human being. I'm proud to call him a fellow #MAN. #men #women #yes

Dylan’s is an indefensible rhetorical move because, clearly, habitually hurtful people are *not good people.* If the post-#MeToo, post-2016 election world has taught us anything, it's that many of us, no matter our best intentions, are not good people.

Does Cosby’s attorney #TomMesereau truly believe over 50 women, who share very similar accounts of what happened with Cosby, are all only motivated by money? 

That may be Mesereau’s own motivation in this, but the women are fighting a system that denies them support.

@HitlersSonJim @EverleashLLC @Antagonizer11 @PaulLee85 @jimmykimmel Kimmel has total disrespect for women..you can witness it over and over on YouTube. Women run from him but he just keeps up the attacks. Where is the humor in this? Where is the #metoo movement on? I'm sick of the bias, it's okay for some men but not others. @jimmykimmel pervert.


Abi Martins-Adeniran
Too many men see sex through the same lens as #Trump: something you get, not something you expect your partner to want as much as yourself; something that boosts your masculine authority while sullying women’s worth. And too many women have adopted that same script. #metoo

"Men like Robbins, whose estimated $500 million fortune has been amassed by trading on individual empowerment, are an ally to women on the sole condition that women are an ally to them" —@katieunderwrite on @TonyRobbins is 👌🏻https://t.co/mNNBqW31J5


Evie Marie
@RandalStevens63 @JessSplash @jes_chastain @TonyRobbins My quick Internet search tells me he didn't go to college so... 
I agree with that. The #MeToo movement is using its power to get what it wants - equality for men and women and an end to sexual abuse. What Tony Robbins said was an attempt to demean that.

MeToo has followers that want to dismantle the church, because they think all men are hypocrites. The church is for women and men, and despite the attitudes of a few, God and Jesus built the church for both sexes. A few hateful women stands for MeToo. Phil.

En sak är väldigt viktig att vara mycket tydlig med.
Det är INTE media eller #metoo som är orsak till #svenskaakademien:s haveri.
Kvinnorna som berättade och DN:s skickliga journalister har gjort en riktig hjälteinsats i kampen mot förnekelse och tystnadskultur.

Randall Stevens
@Ms_Evie_Marie @JessSplash @jes_chastain @TonyRobbins He was stating a point.  In the video clip when he is pushing, he CLEARLY states that HE represents the MeToo movement.  "The more I push, the safer I feel"  The woman represents "Men" and their unconscious (or conscious) pushback. It's stunning that people miss the intent.

I invented MenToo to counteract MeToo, but another hastag worth promoting is WomenandMenToo. It is a sign of the end times when women are endlessly attacking men. Once apon a time men and women used to be close. What has happened to the old days. Phil.

@aishlingmara @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Uh, I don't believe the #metoo movement was ever supposed to be about child molestation. That is a horrible crime, in itself! It was about adult predators, who were using their power over "so-called" helpless, adult women, who SET themselves up to be sexually assalted.

@RandalStevens63 @JessSplash @jes_chastain @TonyRobbins If men are so worried that their behaviour will be seen as harassment they need to change their behaviour. If women are worried that men will discriminate against women then I've got news: women are already discriminated against! That's what #MeToo #TimesUp are trying to stop!

Putting down the #MeToo movement then later changing your statement that you actually support it to save face, does not disregard what you first said. An apology should admit you have traits of a misogynist and then make clear your desire to want to change that way of thinking.

MenToo has meaning and is inclusive of men. MeToo is a feminist attack on men, and is not inclusive. MeToo is a victimization of men. Some men are scared to cry out. I am not. One lady commented, suggesting licking a lady's back is evil. It is not evil. Phil.

@kaitlynbristowe @SexWithEmily I think the #MeToo movement is largely attributed to the rise of and prevalence of pornography. If you don't follow @FightTheNewDrug you should. It's a very scientific take on the dancers of porn on the human mind.

@ChrissieEvert @TonyRobbins Let it be clear that I disagree with Tony's view on the #MeToo movement but to be fair, he quite often does that pushing action, no? Now, if you've always disagreed with that then I have no argument. And, yes, women, men, no one likes being pushed around

@E_M_Jenkins While the #MeToo movement was powerful in enabling women to open up about their experiences, many voices of those that are people of color, trans people, etc., were suppressed by white women due to our society’s issue with intersectionality. #COMS3200S18

@womensmarch @SafeSpacesDC @melissagira @swopusa @KateDAdamo @supporthosechi @anaorsomething Perfect example of why I would have NOTHING to do with a Women's March! YOU are the same people screaming that we, "MeToo" cannot protect themselves with a gun, but it's ok for women to place themselves into "THE" most vulnerable position ever, in an "illegal" trade.

metoo案件では、まだ男性集団での女性の共有化ということがあまり見えないのが気になってる。個人間の問題ならまだ対処の余地がある気がするけど対集団となると更に面倒になる。痴漢も集団となるとより質が悪い。

#metoo の告白は良い啓発になるだろう。応援する。しかし個人名を晒しあげて一方的に攻撃する、復讐するのはどうなんだろう。もし悪意を持った人が潔白の人を晒しあげていたらどうするのか。

@ScarilyCheerful @wraithburn @Sheraoftexas @DarkShamashAran @NestorRedux @NickBuser5 Right. 

That is why every situation should be examined individually.

The default "believe all accusers" component of #metoo is poisonous because it makes it nearly impossible for innocent people to be exonerated in the minds of others.

@5dhJ88NBwd1UjCk こういう意見を受け入れる、というのが具体的にどのようなことを表すのかよく分かりません。元ツイートの彼は「みんなが告発してるから私も」というのを嫌っているようですが、MeTooは取りも直さず「私も」という意味なので、それを受け入れるならMeToo運動そのものを辞めなくてはいけなくなります。

Mystifying
I've been having dreams of my rapist lately. He was never put in jail even though the judge said he was guilty. Even though this all happened many years ago when I was ages 3-7, I still have nightmares. #MeToo to all of you who have also never had your voices heard, ur not alone.

撮影はカメラマンとモデルの信頼関係が絶対必要。上下関係はダメですね、対等でないとダメだと思います。

Part of the Weinstein #metoo movement is that women who worked a lifetime for careers faced the possibility of losing their career for speaking up. Their careers were only part of the issue. Frustratingly THEIR reputation would also be tarnished for speaking up against an abuser.

#Metoo でまず思うのは、セクハラが痴漢が性の不平等がと言う前に、 まず「他人が不快に思うことをしてはいけません。」という保育園か幼稚園で習うことを出来てない大人がかなりたくさんいるのではないか、ということですなぁ。これは男女関係なく、同性同士でも全ての場合のおいて言えると思う。

@Lee_in_Iowa @davidhogg111 Sexual harassment (typically of a woman) in a workplace, or other professional or social situation, involving the making of unwanted sexual advances or obscene remarks.

ブスにとっての #metoo のツイートに対して、私のように痴漢やセクハラにあったことのない人が本当のブスだから…というリプがあったけれど、痴漢やセクハラに合う＝女性的な魅力的がある、という刷り込みそのままで絶句…。被害者に「あなたには魅力があるんだよ」なんて言っても誰も幸せにならない。

Sexuelle Übergriffe im öffentlichen Raum
#Neuruppin: Zwei Jugendliche (13,14) ermutigen zwei Mädchen (15) zum Alkoholkonsum. Danach gehen die Jungs mit einer der beiden zu einer Bank, versuchen sie zu küssen und der Ältere nähert sich ihr sexuell. Das Mädchen wehrt sich, kann sich befreien und läuft nach Hause.

(2/2) #MeToo, voices like @Emma4Change, @davidhogg111, and others, all are possible because there is a platform for them to speak from.  And it's working.  So instead of destroying it let's seek to make these places more tolerant, and protect them by not tolerating intolerance.

@nowthisnews On one point only I agree we should not shame the individuals who harrass women. We need to work to change the culture that allows the behavior. Shame creates violence and is counter to the intention of the #metoo movement. Of course @TonyRobbins can't understand #maleprivilege

@TakaaKuun Kuka/ketkä ovat tämä #MeToo , joka asiasta Jussin mukaan vaikenee? Ahdistelun uhreilta ei taatusti ole kielletty kyseiseen kampanjaan osallistumista. Nää oletukset/vaateet siitä, että jotkut tietyt henkilöt nostaisivat asioita esille nimenomaan Twitterissä, ovat erikoisia. 1/2

@BodyForWife Loved it! Honestly, this guy was just chugging along with his self-help nonsense and he should have just avoided having any "opinion" on the #metoo movement at all. This will hurt his wallet and I, for one, don't care that it will at all.


Elizabeth Jenkins
@bailey_watroba It’s often hard to be heard because many voices are not brought to the table. Many voices during the #metoo movement were silenced and ignored. This often happens to individuals from intersectional identities regardless of the topic or movement.

電気ミント (NoNuke NoWar)
女性が男装するのも別にいいと思うし、それと同じ事で男性が女装するのもいいと思う。ただしいきなり抱きつくのは痴漢であって犯罪ですからダメです。　 #MeToo https://t.co/GJsWQ8eqjW


Quattro＠Mafty Naveyu Erin
例えば同じ女性から＃Metoo問題に疑念を呈したフランスの有名女優がいましたが、あっという間に叩かれて撤回を余儀なくされました。いつの間にか弱者だった被害者が言論的に強者となって異なる意見を封殺しました。これは一体何だろうと言うのが私の疑問点でした。


Tsukie Hill
If he cares, he'll meet with women who are part of the #metoo #timesup
movements and listen. We know his clients are abusers cause he said 'a client wouldn't  hire an attractive woman because he couldn't control himself' I think.

Elizabeth Jenkins
@jensenluc2 Also, it silenced voices that were already unheard. Therefore, movements such as #metoo need to shine a light on the many, many individuals who have experienced the trauma; not only white middle (or upper clsss) women.


Volk
@mark_melbin @OpenCarrierWA @PrisonPlanet Oh Mark, you’re so right. He’s just a harmless old billionaire who loves people and just wants to do the right thing.

That’s why in 2011, when it was reported that he beat up his girlfriend, he was never charged and the story magically went away. #metoo

Such an innocent soul...

MeTooに反対していたのは煽動に乗り声をあげた一般の被害者の事を考えたからで、

@TNJed615 @EricaKaiser_ @Thereapper69 @CNN To be fair, if #MeToo movement has proven anything, it's that even the wokest people can be predators. I liked Bill Clinton back in the day, and he cheated on his wife more than anyone could count. When it comes to men, you have to be a realist.

本来は触れなくても良いのかも知れません。しかし、目についた以上は書こうと思います。まず日本に於ける＃Metoo運動。声を挙げた人間の裏が非常に悪かった。しかも不起訴になっても訴え続けた。法的に罪に問われなかった人間をいつまでも追求し、しかも倒閣運動に絡めた。これが致命傷だったと思う。 https://t.co/f7YjZGk5N8

契約書も大切だけど、それだけではないと思う
ブラック企業がそうであるように、逆に不利な契約を結ばされて「同意した」と見なされることもある
ハリウッドの #metoo が長く放置されたのは守秘義務という契約があったから
芸術を盾にした犯罪を許さない、被害を訴えやすい状況を作るのが大切だと思う

@AnnaAkana @natalietran @xxYunz @akarinah0 The problem is that white men are the gatekeepers, as seen by #metoo. White men actively pursue their own self-interest.

はあちゅうさんが「Metoo被害者女性への共感をまず最初に書く」ことがなんで重要なのかというと。
「自分の体験で考えたら、ハラスメントはひどい行為だ」という発言が無いことで、過去の告発が「あれ？　本当はそんなに深刻じゃないの？」と思われてしまう可能性があるから。

@madblack65 It's one thing for men like @TonyRobbins to demean the #MeToo movement but when I see women jump on board, especially women who act all sanctimonious in their sexism and victim blaming it just hurts. All these brave stories but a man says they're lies and they believe him? Ugh 😑

As serious &amp; real sexual harassment is, we must have the ability to tell when it's not or else lives may be destroyed by uneducated accusations.  
Q: Is it sexual harassment if one approves of it? Not trying to start a tweet-war. Just want a meaningful dialogue.

So there it is, the main reason @Globelamp tries to spin and gaslight everyone away from the truth and what I’m saying. I REALLY AM an abused, silenced, #MeToo single mother in the ‘music industry’ &amp; I don’t care if I’m any good or if I ever make any money. I just like music.


Lindsey Sharratt
@jowilliams293 Agreed. It actually concerns me that The Breakfast Club would come under a #MeToo lens.  This is overthinking in retrospect. Exploration of boundaries, self and sexuality is part of identity development as a teenager.

We all know that patriarchy hurts women and men...not necessarily equally but differently. And with that knowledge, its important to allow both men and women to reckon with the effects of their trauma openly and with dignity...and without judgement. #MeToo

顔や名前を出して告発している人を、「その程度のこと」「そう思うのはあなただけ」って潰させないために、その告発の重きを示すために、それまで誰にも言えなかったつらい体験を晒しているんだよ。

Why some women fight against #metoo advocates? Because we have become trauma bonded, become too familiar to pain. It is possible to unconsciously defend the same kind of men that abuse us, this also includes an attraction to such men when it comes to romance.

MeToo関連で色々な告発があり、世間には平気で弱い立場の人を理不尽に踏み潰す人間が結構な数いることに驚く。自分はどちらかというと周りに感謝し過ぎて時折なめられ、損して嫌だなと思っていたけれど、踏み潰す人間であるよりも余程マシな生き方だったのではなかろうかと寂しく自分を慰めている。

@eyesparalyze @DeannaLorraine7 @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber The irony is that #MeToo is taking women back to the 70's. Think it through. No guy wants to risk losing everything because a woman had a bad day. It's already happening. Women have become a liability. There were already laws in place. File charges, or handle it like a big girl.

@TomimPA @JiiPeePuro @teemu_p_peltola @kirsi_koo @VeikkoW @Jrvinen_J No siis metoon pohjimmainen ajatus on käsitellä niitä valtasuhteita miesten ja naisten välillä. Se ei ihan päde kun kyseessä on kaksi naista vaikkakin siinä tilanteessa myös hyväksikäytetään miesten luomia rakenteita. Siksi se ei ole puhtaasti metoo-luokkaan kuuluva.

It's been over two years since I saw my abuser and I still suffer flashbacks so bad I can hardly leave the house most days. I was 88 pounds when I left him. This story is not uncommon and it is 100% the fault of the asshole who decides to victimize #metoo

@RationalMale @TonyRobbins He shouldn't have caved in. He clearly stated his point in the crowd about #victimhood at the time. The #Metoo #ideological echo-chamber IS reacting and attacking no matter how sorry he is. Which he shouldn't be if they were truly listening.

20/ So as we continue Sexual Assault Awareness Month: be prepared for more #MeToo stories. Be aware that people- men as well as women- will be especially on edge as this topic is in the news, and will talk or write about their experiences more than usual- as I have been doing.


Lori Saldaña
15/ What I've learned from all this is: It's an epidemic. As  #MeToo  has shown- we are only recently listening to women who have survived abuse, and are willing and able to speak up.

And it's complicated. Women delay reporting these crimes- or, like me, never report them at all

@nytchinese @HernandezJavier 左媒又来（故意）混淆概念了。美国最近的所谓#MeToo很大程度上是无聊的女权主义分子无病呻吟、无事生非、故弄玄虚之举，高岩绝对不是一个简单的性骚扰案件的受害者，她是专制政权的牺牲品！这两者有本质的区别。

Jaime Wiley
@TonyRobbins It's a sad day when you have to apologize for making the logical point of, "weaponized victimhood actually does nothing for the person wielding it". And then to claim that you assaulted her further proved your point about things like #metoo going too far.

@TaranaBurke So no one can have a different perspective on a subject? This is why so many do not take this #metoo movement seriously. 
I don't think he was trying to justify the bad behavior of some men.

#metoo で自らの経験を告白している人たちの勇気には本当に尊敬する。ワインスタインの件しかり、その件に触れて、自分の考えをきちんと主張している男性陣の勇気にも。 #HeForShe  の理念の通り、全員の参加が必要な話。自分の母親、姉妹、彼女、奥さんが被害にあってても見過ごすことができるのか？

#metoo とかで難しいなと思うのは、第三者からみてその告発が真実なのかデマなのか分からない所ですよ。だから様子見してて後から真実だと分かった時に「あの時黙っていた人も同罪」とか言われるとなんだなぁと。加担した後でデマだと確定したら「デマを拡散した情弱」扱いされるわけで。

It's a man's #metoo moment, inflicted upon him as a boy but due to his toxic masculine conditioning, 1. was psychologically self-restrained from processing his trauma &amp; 2. saw women as a means to reclaim his masculinity.

His work has depended on believing in "not being a victim, but a victor" as if survivors have control over all things that have happened to them. That isn't something u can believe in if ur truly for the #MeToo movement bc it requires placing the responsibility on the abusers.

What you said and did didn’t “suggest” disrespect for the movement, you dismissed it entirely with very evident misogyny. By all means, stay far, far away. https://t.co/BOQMuqxKry

@TonyRobbins disappointed in video comments regarding #MeToo movement. Maybe you’ve been talking so much, you’ve forgotten how to listen. As a white male you are at the top of the power chain. Get off your high horse and start connecting with people who are not like you!

パワハラ・セクハラ被害に遭った人、まあ #MeToo というんですか。そういう人に対して「なぜ今になって言うのか。話題を作りたいのか」等という人が居るが、力関係で一方的に劣勢な場合、その力関係が均衡した事後に告発するのは戦術の常識で、卑怯でも目立ちたいからでも無い。つまり面従腹背の戦術。

@sunita_krishnan But what if they couldn't report to police out of fear at that time!!! Not all women get support in our society to even listen to those women who get oppressed. There are so many women who are still facing oppression!! This what #metoo campaign is meant for!!!


The New World
Hashtag MeToo: The person is not to blame. 

The belief is to blame - women are inferior. Women are playthings. Women are possessions.

No matter the punishment, if the belief remains, so will the behaviour and the mindset.

Solution? Change the belief.

@womensmarch Are you just going to skip over the fact is is being used for pedophiles and child prostitution. And because they are being paid to have sex that makes it okay. If the #metoo victims are paid then it would be okay? This is so messed up!

During #metoo @johnwenzel told me he's heard many rumors of comedians in town's abusive behavior towards women, but blamed victims for not "going on the record." but even when women do come forward, he keeps covering abusers like TJ. fuck the denver post. it's already a joke.

@faithandflying I'm upset this girl was treated like a sexual object. It happened to me too off and on in my life. I had to get old for it to stop. Being a #MeToo Woman is painful in SO MANY ways. But the worst for me was never feeling heard but only feeling seen when I had things to say.

@TonyRobbins I am insulted that you would apologize to MeToo for expressing your 1st amendment right's! As a female I find MeToo movement to be insulting to real women &amp; cater to women who feel embolden wearing a pussy hat or vagina outfit which insults women. Retrack ur apology?

And with all the #metoo crap, I don't believe half of these allegations. It's sad that It became a publicity thing like "if you don't put #metoo you don't understand being a REAL woman." No, a guy telling me I look nice is not sexual harassment, sorry.

Man, you gotta love the primary Hollywood spokespeople for the #MeToo movement:

1) Meryl Streep, who gave a standing ovation to a man, Roman Polanski, who drugged and raped a 13 year-old girl.

2) Oprah Winfrey, who pimped out young girls to Harvey Weinstein. 

3) Kimmel

@HeyZuesChristo @lizzymartineez @Manateeschools Oh boy, here we go. Women wear pants too. You have nipples too so maybe you should wear a bra, guy. Acceptable practice of keeping women down and subdued isn't flying anymore and that makes you scared. Get over it. Looks like you should have expected the backlash of #MeToo.

Hey @TonyRobbins “All you've done is basically use a drug called significance to make yourself feel good” in response to #metoo movement. BOYCOTT HIM! Let him
Interview a powerful woman and not hire her because she’s ‘beautiful’ He’s a fraud and so self absorbed he is oblivious.

@krassenstein And there's a million military issues we can focus on

かつて浅田彰が荒木経惟を「偽もの」と断じた言説がMeTooきっかけで出回ってて、その明晰で辛辣な語りにうっとりしちゃうんだけど、浅田彰にかかったら世の中の大半の領域が、即ち自分の愛するものの多くが「偽もの」と切り捨てられてしまうということは一応わかっとかないとまずいと思う。

@TonyRobbins I watched the 11 minute video and read your apology. I don’t think you get it. Its about impowerment and releasing shame. Ask female friends if they have ever been sexually harrased. I bet everyone says yes. And by the way #metoo. @TanaraMcLean

@senyorreporter This pairing up of ideas is dangerous. For example, if you are a Dem you must support gun control and Palestine et al. You can't build consensus and compromise this way. The issue of teacher salaries already had the metoo voters. Why double down on that?

#TonyRobinson comment and story/analogy is the exact purpose of the #MeToo movement. If a man hiring can’t get past sexualizing a women and a man who backs up those horrible actions  therein lies one of the many issues &amp; why #MeToo is necessary.

WELL  Tony Robbins CERTAINLY motivated me.......to eliminate shyster con artists like him who prey on the weak and intimidate women- while being utterly tone deaf as to what #metoo is about. Oh and BTW- the apologies are worthless


Laura Resists
Listen up jerks! If you apologize AFTER you are exposed, that's not sorrow and regret for your actions. That's just covering your own ass. Save it for your friends and family. To everyone else, you're just another  asshole. #Metoo


NYT Opinion
This year's Equal Pay Day has brought back a whole different set of memories, writes @Lilly_Ledbetter:

“You’re going to be my next woman at Goodyear.”

“Oh, you didn’t wear your bra today.”

“If you don’t go to bed with me, you won’t have a job.”

In anthropology, #MeToo needs to go beyond naming perpetrators. It’s not enough.
We need to:
➡️Look at institutional responses
➡️Evaluate our own ethical codes
➡️Develop training programs (watch this space)
➡️Acknowledge sexual violence occurs in the academy and the field

I'm either without words about what Robbins said or the more I read his 'excuses' and facsimile of an 'apology', I am overrun with words I don't want to print. He has no idea of what he speaks. Tony Robbins apologizes for #MeToo comments https://t.co/qpEUJzpTq2

@TonyRobbins As a real, multiple x victim, I trust that Tony Robbins made a misstep in his comments,but that mistake is not the man he is. He helped me to overcome every thing Ive been through. To become a successful,and mentally healthy woman. Don't tear down someone who helps so many #metoo

I think the most telling thing about @TonyRobbins' statement against #MeToo and how it perfectly reflected rape culture, is the idea that people should be shamed for seeking significance. Or maybe just women should? How about the significance of charging people to hear you speak?

A movement about sexual assault is called #120db and hollywood ignores it too. Not famous women are raped in Europe and the mainstream media doesn't care.

アラーキーとかの写真家がどうもMetooで攻撃され始めてるようだが、正直おれは「ヌード写真」に芸術性とかの価値を芥子粒ほどにも認めてないので、女の裸の写真を妙に有り難がってこの手の勘違いした「先生」を作るの止めた方がいいと思う。こいつらのヌード写真ならＡＶの方が一万倍価値あるぞ。

Marwa Abdou
Distilling definitions/forms of consent, misconduct, social norms, normative behaviors &amp; how boundaries aren't just physical they are also mental
and emotional ... these are nuances that are indispensable to the #metoo conversation &amp; ought to be disentangled as well.


Marwa Abdou
There is a golden opportunity for us to talk about the before as well as the after. #MeToo isn't a man/woman conversation- no age, gender, race, disability, or socioeconomic boundaries is immune.

James Donaghy
Of all these dickless pieces of shit complaining that #MeToo has gone too far, none of them cite the one case when it did go too far – Aziz Ansari. Can't help thinking it's something to do with the M-word.

@BillyBaldwin @TonyRobbins This incident took place sometime ago but only recently got traction and attention. Only then did he say “he saw the light”. His initial reaction was not that. He has his own thoughts on #metoo but to invite that women &amp; use physical intimidation showed his real feelings.

@girlsreallyrule It is the STRUCTURAL POWER of the #meToo movement that empowers the women to finally speak on their own behalf, knowing that even tho there still will be many who disbelieve and attack them, there's a critical mass of people calling BS on the harassers and their apologists.

Anyways, that’s a bit about why I care so much about raising money for @ORCC_Tweets. And I want to talk more about it because I often hear survivors express they are unsure about getting help - although it sounds like, with #MeToo, that’s changing. Crisis centers need support.

@TonyRobbins With self-awareness &amp; ANGER, we can grow into our life vision with integrity, so that life that 'happens to us' is one of honor. Without anger there is no honor. Anger is not about blame/blame is disempowerment. #anger101book #metoo

@PeterWMurphy1 @nowthisnews Physical intimidation is wrong, but much of Robbins' initial criticism of #MeToo was absolutely correct. And his apology was a lame caving in to public pressure. That's not what leaders do. If you think that this movement hasn't empowered many man-hating women, you're quite naive

This. 

If she says no, it's not a challenge to get her to change her mind. It may have been hard enough to say no the first time, to make sure you heard it. It doesn't matter if she's showing cleavage, laughs at your jokes, or appeared to flirt with you. 

No means NO.

@Brian_Douglas7 #MeToo is a man shaming #hategroup disguised as victim’s advocacy that operates like a political organization. Totalitarian &amp; tyrannical. No celebrity or crowd drawing function is safe from any of these hate groups that are popping up.

@LisaAbeyta It is an undeniable fact that there are women who are using #metoo to destroy men's lives (often for little or nothing) because they have deap-seated hatred for men. And there is no question that the movement has made male-female relationships more difficult.

@Rev_Xavier I agree that Robbins is full of shit. But I'm talking about his lame-ass retraction, not his original comments, which were spot-on. Can you really deny that #metoo has given men pause in workplace relationships with women? Even complimenting a woman can be turned against someone.

I see the NYT site has the FBI/Cohen story in 3rd position behind Antioch College/MeToo and Trump's unreliable babbling on Syria. It would be so biased to make it 1st!

It's not like this is Comey's leaked letter about his dud of an investigation or something really serious.

Ante esta respuesta, la entrevistadora se queda un poco mosca. Le dice que unos pocos hombres, pero ¿y el movimiento #MeToo? Y a esto la señora responde que la liberación sexual de "su generación" nos ha afectado mal y está haciendo que las mujeres hoy pierdan DIGNIDAD y ESTATUS.

@JoseILeyvajr @cowgirl_bebop @Vadothe22nd @CNN JL - you're conflating #metoo with many other things. There's a lot of social change going on at the moment, but all you need to ask yourself is whether you object to empowering women coming forward to address systemic harassment and abuse.

That's it.

@TaranaBurke Although there are MEN and women who have been sexually harassed, grown ups eventually move on and grow up, rather than whine and snivel. Unlike the harpies of the "MeToo movement." #MoveOnAndGetaLife

@TonyRobbins All I could think while I watched the video of your UPW event in San Jose was that you were making your point through intimidation. No woman in the #MeToo movement is using the role of victim to get ahead. To even think that momentarily is horrible.
